# Backup script

A fork from backup script.

And refactored.

## Execute

./backup.rb

Copy files in ./ori/ to ./target/ .

If there is a file with the same name at target folder, it will skip to next file.

## Customize

./backup.rb --from source/ --to target/

## Why not just 'cp -r source/* target/'?

... I don't know
